                    <b class="introTitle">Picture this:</b>
                    <p> You are 37 years old. You are feel stuck in a dying field. You have an opportunity to actually move into a career due to financial blessings. You tell yourself that it's time to make a big change. One day you are watching YouTube videos and come across an ad at just the right time. This school talked about how they could take a person with zero coding experience and qualify them for a mid-level position at the end of their 13-week program. The people in that ad speak very highly of that school and genuinely seemed to enjoy what they did. And what's better is it's not an overly saturated field and the financial outlook is pretty solid too! </p>
                    <p>It gets you curious. What exactly is this place? Is this even real? Can it be? So, being the cautiously optimistic person you are, you do some internet sleuthing and vet the company pretty hard to make sure it is as good as they claim. So you sign up with them and within a month you are driving across country to Cali to begin classes at this school and embark on this great adventure, not really knowing where it's going to lead or how things will turn out.</p>
                    <b class="introTitle">So who am I?</b>
                    <p>My name is Joe Lambert. I'm a software engineer and this school is known as <em>Coding Dojo</em>. My journey there was great and I learned a lot on an intense and fast-paced schedule and made a lot of lifetime memories with a lot of really amazing people who are doing amazing things. But my journey doesn't stop there. It merely began here. Now I'm working solo on projects and continuing to learn a lot of cool things while running into my own new challenges in the wild world of software engineering.</p>
                    <p>In my freetime, I'm a gamer at heart and try to remain an active member in my local church. Recently I've picked up hiking and I'm forever a foodie. If it's packed with flavor, chances are I'll love it. Life's too short for bland food.</p>
                    <p>I'm relatively conservative myself, but I get along with all types of people and am generally a chameleon in whatever situation I'm put in. I love getting to know people's stories and what makes them tick. As you might imagine, this had an impact in obtaining my previous education in <em>Integrated Marketing Communications</em>.</p>
                    <p>I'm on the Autism spectrum. In some ways even though it's a social disorder, it's actually enabled me to thrive in certain social situations because I know what it's like to be an outsider and also I've had to work to learn the system in order to succeed.</p>
                    <p>Life has and continues to throw me a lot of curveballs. In the process of time, I've learned to just lean into whatever happens because you never know where the adventure will take you or how you'll learn and grow from it. Some of my greatest memories in life came from stuff I didn't plan on doing. This career change is one such example. I like to keep stress low and curiousity high whenever possible.</p>
                    <b class="introTitle">What do I offer?</b>
                    <p>I'm a full-stack software engineer in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong> as well as <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong>CSS</strong>. I'm an ever-curious soul who loves to learn and faces challenges with an intense desire to succeed. I like trying new things and breaking things in order to fix them. I like to know the whys and not just the hows and I do my best to have a full understanding of whatever I take on. I've worked solo on my projects, but I've also spent hours after class pouring over code with my cohorts and learning and figuring out things together. I'm comfortable in either situation.</p>
